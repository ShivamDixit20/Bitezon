Bitezon – Full-Stack Food Deal Comparison Platform

1. Project Title
Bitezon – Full-Stack Food Deal Comparison Platform

2. Problem Statement
Ordering food online has become a routine, but users often waste significant time
switching between multiple food delivery services such as Zomato, Swiggy, and Uber
Eats to find the best price, quickest delivery, or most attractive discount for the same
dish. This inconsistency causes confusion and leads to missed opportunities for
savings.

Bitezon aims to solve this problem by providing a unified platform that compares
food prices, discounts, and available offers across multiple delivery apps. Users can
instantly discover the best deal for their favorite dishes or restaurants, saving both
time and money.
